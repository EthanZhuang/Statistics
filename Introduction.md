# Statistics 

## First course: #1
### Ask you a question, what can statistics do?

* The truth of the statistics?
* Is the thing that we want to discuss?
    - EX: why people eat fast food?

Descriptive & inference statistics:
D: We d=fubd alot of data and make an stattistics 

I(maybe so, maybe not): much more complex situation, only use small amount of events to test how likely it is. 

- uncertainty

## Second course: Mathematical Thinking #2 
Visualize the big number the number is the key to know Statistics.

Why we learn statistics?
```Thinking mathematically isn't just about understanding numbers better. It's about asking important questions about the world around us. And letting numbers illustrate those questions```

## Third Cource:

middle number/ average number 
measure a central of tendency: summary of a group as whole - expectation/ 

normal distribution:


distribution: frequency


mean: it's about the number that is 

median: take the mean of a two middle number 

misleading?
outlier: the things that is out of the median 

mode: can be useful if you have a large number of samples. It's the peak of the the statistics 

skewed: 


## Fourth cource:
measure of speed: 
test scroe
price bubble
poster

EX:
youtube viewers, is the range, the large the audience is, the measure of speed will be more easily to spread out

IOR: who is the primary group who watch you, a better idea of core idea. 

variance - we can use scatter plot 

variability - 


infernecial statistics: 
outlier: 

standard deviation: the avg number that we use to deviate, and it'll be affected by extreme large and small numbers 

average: sometimes can be deeply misleading




## 20200923 敘述統計（I）-列表法與圖示法
Ask you five questions before you start the course.
* 何謂統計學 What is Statistics?
* 統計科學? The Science of Statistics?
* 統計學的用途? What types of Statistical Application can be used in Business?


### 何謂統計學?
任何一個領域的**問題或爭議**，皆能透過**收集與分析數據**來找出最適合解答，並加以**制定策略**

日常應用的統計學:
1. 民意調查: 收集選民回應並預測選舉結果
2. 顧客意見: 消費者提供資訊，以便公司分析出消費者對產品的喜好
3. 產品管理: 出貨前，針對產品抽樣檢查，以便控管出貨或保留的決策
4. 其他: 天氣預報、物價指數、經濟指標、交通意外事故統計等...
