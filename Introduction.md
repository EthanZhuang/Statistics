# Statistics 

## First course: #1
### Ask you a question, what can statistics do?

* The truth of the statistics?
* Is the thing that we want to discuss?
    - EX: why people eat fast food?

Descriptive & inference statistics:
D: We d=fubd alot of data and make an stattistics 

I(maybe so, maybe not): much more complex situation, only use small amount of events to test how likely it is. 

- uncertainty

## Second course: Mathematical Thinking #2 
Visualize the big number the number is the key to know Statistics.

Why we learn statistics?
```Thinking mathematically isn't just about understanding numbers better. It's about asking important questions about the world around us. And letting numbers illustrate those questions```

## Third Cource:

middle number/ average number 
measure a central of tendency: summary of a group as whole - expectation/ 

normal distribution:


distribution: frequency


mean: it's about the number that is 

median: take the mean of a two middle number 

misleading?
outlier: the things that is out of the median 

mode: can be useful if you have a large number of samples. It's the peak of the the statistics 

skewed: 


## Fourth cource:
measure of speed: 
test scroe
price bubble
poster

EX:
youtube viewers, is the range, the large the audience is, the measure of speed will be more easily to spread out

IOR: who is the primary group who watch you, a better idea of core idea. 

variance - we can use scatter plot 

variability - 


infernecial statistics: 
outlier: 

standard deviation: the avg number that we use to deviate, and it'll be affected by extreme large and small numbers 

average: sometimes can be deeply misleading
